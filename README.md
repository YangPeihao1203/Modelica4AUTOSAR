# Visual Modeling and Simulation of AUTOSAR Application Layer Models Using Modelica

## Overview
This repository provides an open-source Modelica-based framework for visual modeling and simulation of AUTOSAR application layer models. The project introduces a method for encapsulating AUTOSAR constructs in Modelica, enabling multi-domain simulations with improved flexibility and interoperability.

## Features
- **Encapsulation of AUTOSAR Models**: The `M2` folder contains a structured AUTOSAR model library implemented in Modelica.
- **Multi-domain Simulation**: The `AUTOSAR_HeadLamp.mo` model integrates AUTOSAR with a Modelica-based automotive lighting system (`HeadLamp.mo`).
- **Open-source and Extensible**: Facilitates industry collaboration and supports cross-domain applications beyond automotive systems.

## Repository Structure
```
📂 M2/ # Encapsulated AUTOSAR model library
├── 📂 VisibleElements/ # Visual modeling elements for drag-and-drop AUTOSAR SWC construction
├── 📂 Examples/ # Ten modeling examples across automotive, electrical, and mechanical domains
├── 📂 Utilities/ # Utility components and helper functions for model development

```

## Examples

This repository includes **10 comprehensive example models** showcasing the versatility and power of our Modelica-based AUTOSAR framework.  
- **3 examples** are fully comparable with official Simulink benchmarks, including detailed performance comparisons.  
- **7 examples** highlight the multi-domain modeling capabilities, covering electrical, mechanical, and automotive systems.

For **in-depth descriptions, usage instructions, simulation results, and performance metrics**, please refer to the dedicated showcase document: [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md).  
Explore these cases to see how our approach enables flexible, extensible, and high-fidelity system modeling across domains.


## 📘 AUTOSAR Model Encapsulation Guide

For developers interested in understanding how AUTOSAR software components are structurally encapsulated using Modelica, we provide a detailed reference:

📄 [AUTOSAR_Library_Encapsulation_Guide.md](./AUTOSAR_Library_Encapsulation_Guide.md)

This guide includes:
- Mapping between AUTOSAR meta-model definitions and Modelica classes
- Inheritance strategies and Modelica limitations (e.g., multi-inheritance simplification)
- Visual modeling conventions and usage of `VisibleElements`
- Guidelines for extending the model library in compliance with AUTOSAR standards

We highly recommend reading this document if you're contributing to or customizing the AUTOSAR library.


## Installation & Usage
### Prerequisites
