# Visual Modeling and Simulation of AUTOSAR Application Layer Models Using Modelica

## Overview
This repository provides an open-source Modelica-based framework for visual modeling and simulation of AUTOSAR application layer models. The project introduces a method for encapsulating AUTOSAR constructs in Modelica, enabling multi-domain simulations with improved flexibility and interoperability.

## Features
- **Encapsulation of AUTOSAR Models**: The `M2` folder contains a structured AUTOSAR model library implemented in Modelica.
- **Multi-domain Simulation**: The `AUTOSAR_HeadLamp.mo` model integrates AUTOSAR with a Modelica-based automotive lighting system (`HeadLamp.mo`).
- **Open-source and Extensible**: Facilitates industry collaboration and supports cross-domain applications beyond automotive systems.

## üìò AUTOSAR Model Encapsulation Guide

For developers interested in understanding how AUTOSAR software components are structurally encapsulated using Modelica, we provide a detailed reference:

üìÑ [AUTOSAR_Library_Encapsulation_Guide.md](./AUTOSAR_Library_Encapsulation_Guide.md)

This guide includes:
- Mapping between AUTOSAR meta-model definitions and Modelica classes
- Inheritance strategies and Modelica limitations (e.g., multi-inheritance simplification)
- Visual modeling conventions and usage of `VisibleElements`
- Guidelines for extending the model library in compliance with AUTOSAR standards

We highly recommend reading this document if you're contributing to or customizing the AUTOSAR library.

## üîç Threats and Future Work
This work is the first to integrate Modelica with AUTOSAR, enabling multi-domain modeling and simulation of application-layer software. While it demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness, several limitations remain.

Due to the vast scope of the AUTOSAR standard, our implementation focuses on the application layer and its simulation behaviors, rather than covering the full specification. The comparison is therefore limited to behavioral modeling tools such as Simulink. In addition, to ensure usability, we adopt an intuitive, non-formalized encapsulation of AUTOSAR elements, which may limit formal verification and integration with standard toolchains.

Future work will extend support to more AUTOSAR elements, including RTE and BSW layers, and enhance compatibility with more industrial tools. We also plan to adopt formal methods (e.g., OCL, model transformations) to improve semantic rigor and support automated verification and integration into model-driven workflows.
